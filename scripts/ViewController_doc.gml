/// ViewController_doc
/// Encapsulates the view / drawing management, provides abstract 2d x y coordinates.

// USAGE
// Use createInstance and changeInstancePostion instead of instance_create and simply
// manipulating object position to leave management to this controller.

// Specifics of the used view (isometric) are encapsulated
// (have to be hooked up to object events)
